# GNorm2
***
GNorm2 is a gene name recognition and normalization tool with optimized functions and customizable configuration to the user preferences. The GNorm2 integrates multiple deep learning-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. GNorm2 is freely available to download for stand-alone usage. ([Download GNorm2 here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/Demo/tmTools/download/GNorm2/GNorm2.tar.gz))

## Dependency package
<a name="package"></a>
The codes have been tested using Python3.8/3.9 on CentOS and uses the following main dependencies on a CPU and GPU:
- [TensorFlow 2.3.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [Transformer 4.18.0](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/installation)
- [stanza 1.4.0](stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/)

To install all dependencies automatically using the command:

    $ python3.9 -m venv env39
    $ source env39/bin/activate
    $ python3.9 -m pip install --upgrade pip
    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## Running GNorm2
<a name="pipeline"></a>
Please firstly download [GNorm2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/Demo/tmTools/download/GNorm2/GNorm2.tar.gz) to your local.
Below are the well-trained models (i.e., PubmedBERT/Bioformer) for Gene NER and Species Assignment.

Models for Gene NER:
- gnorm_trained_models/geneNER/GeneNER-PubmedBERT.h5
- gnorm_trained_models/geneNER/GeneNER-Bioformer.h5

Models for Species Assignment:
- gnorm_trained_models/SpeAss/SpeAss-PubmedBERT.h5
- gnorm_trained_models/SpeAss/SpeAss-Bioformer.h5

The parameters of the input/output folders:

- INPUT, default="input"
- OUTPUT, default="output"

[BioC-XML](bioc.sourceforge.net) or [PubTator](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/Demo/tmTools/Format.html) formats are both avaliabel to GNorm2.

1. Preparing the files for process

GNorm2 is designed to process various file in structured formats such as BioC-XML and PubTator.
Please download the example files ([Example](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/Demo/tmTools/download/GNorm2/examples.tar.gz)) and copy the files into the input folder for testing.

2. Run GNorm2

Run Example:

    $ ./GNorm2.sh input output
